"""Cut both cameras into one timeline and lay the narration against it.

    python assemble.py

This video has two footage sources: the deployed website in a real
browser (`web.mp4`), and the release APK on a television (`tv.mp4`).
`beats.py` says which beat belongs to which. This program cuts each beat
out of its own source, joins them in script order, then builds the audio
against the result.

Why the audio is built from the video, and never the other way round
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Each beat is cut to its own narration length plus a little slack, and the
narration is then laid down at the second that beat actually begins in
the finished cut. The two tracks cannot drift, because the audio is
constructed from the picture rather than the picture being trimmed to fit
an audio plan made earlier.

Nothing is ever sped up. A step that genuinely took eleven seconds still
looks like eleven seconds. Screen recordings played fast are a lie about
how quick a product is, and this pipeline refuses to tell it: the only
thing removed is screen that has already settled with nothing being said
over it.

The frame rate problem
----------------------
The browser take is 25fps and the device take is 30fps, because the two
cameras are different tools. Concatenating them without normalising gives
a file whose timestamps drift at every cut, so every segment is
re-encoded to one rate here. That costs a generation on the browser
footage and is worth it.
