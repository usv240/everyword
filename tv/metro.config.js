 * pinned to this app's node_modules so there is never a duplicate React.

 * (X: -> the repo). Node realpaths X: back to C:, which would put every

 * NodeNext import specifiers, resolved for Metro.
 *
 * The shared packages are written for NodeNext, so their own relative
 * imports carry a `.js` extension that points at a `.tsx` file on disk:
 * `packages/karaoke-captions-react/src/native.tsx` imports
 * `./index.js`. Node and tsc both require that spelling. Metro takes it
 * literally, finds no `src/index.js`, and fails the bundle.
 *
 * This went unnoticed for three days and is the most expensive kind of
 * bug this repo can have. The release variant ships a hand-generated
 * bundle (see android/app/build.gradle), that file is not tracked by
 * git, and Gradle has no task that regenerates it. So nothing rebuilt
 * the bundle after the commit that added those extensions, the published
 * APK kept working because its JavaScript predated the change, and the
 * Fire TV app quietly became impossible to build from its own source.
 *
 * Retrying without the extension is enough: Metro then applies its
 * normal sourceExts search and finds the .tsx.
