/**
 * Exactly one layer may answer for CORS.
 *
 * On Lambda this server sits behind a function URL whose own CORS
 * configuration already reflects the request origin. If the app registers
 * CORS as well, the response carries two `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
 * headers and every browser rejects it outright, even when both values
 * are identical.
 *
 * This is the third appearance of the same bug across these projects.
 * Bellwether found it and filed it as friction entry 6. Nightlight then
 * shipped it, and its caregiver app could not load its own data in any
 * browser while curl reported a clean 200 throughout. Here it was live on
 * the deployed MCP endpoint, verified with a real request:
 *
 *   access-control-allow-origin: https://example.com
 *   access-control-allow-origin: https://example.com
 *
 * No command-line check catches it, which is exactly why it keeps
 * happening and why it is pinned here instead.
